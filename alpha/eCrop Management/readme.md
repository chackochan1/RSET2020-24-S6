The project aims to enhance plant health monitoring, improve disease detection, establish a
user-centric marketplace, and enhance agricultural productivity and profitability. The
methodology involves the development of a sensor module to capture plant health data,
image recognition technology for disease detection, and the creation of a user-friendly
marketplace. The project promotes sustainable agriculture, reduces carbon emissions, and
optimizes resource utilization. The integrated solution has the potential to revolutionize
traditional farming practices, leading to enhanced crop productivity, profitability, and
environmental sustainability.
