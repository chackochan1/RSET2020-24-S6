The college admission process can be overwhelming for students seeking to pursue
higher education. With numerous colleges and courses available, it becomes challenging
for students to identify suitable options based on their academic performance. Additionally, the lack of easily accessible and reliable information on college admission cutoffs
further complicates the decision-making process. Therefore, there is a need for a college
recommendation system that simplifies and streamlines the college selection process for
students. The main purpose of the project is to reduce the challenges faced by high
school graduates during the college admission process. It should provide personalized
recommendations to students who are seeking guidance in identifying colleges that align
with their academic aspirations and overall preferences. A suggestion system can help
optimize the allocation of resources by guiding students towards colleges where they have
a higher chance of acceptance, leading to more targeted applications and potentially reducing the burden on admission offices. College admission suggestion system has the
potential to level the playing field by providing equal access to information and guidance
for all students, regardless of their background or resources.
