Our project deals with the creation of a printing website that aims to address challenges faced by a printing shop to improve efficiency,productivity 
and reduce errors.
The printing shops in our locality faces several challenges in managing their operations generating accurate invoices.
The existing process is manual, time-consuming, customer dissatisfaction and loss of revenue. Customers often experience long wait times and delayed order fulfillment, leading to low customer satisfaction.
It enhance customer experience by providing customers to submit orders and payments online.It has features like Order tracking,File management,Billing and invoicing,Real-time notifications,Customer management and Print cost calculator. It could potentially reduce the number of customers who need to physically visit the shop which could reduce the rush or crowd in the shop. It is optimized to ensure timely completion and it automates various processes such as ordering, billing and customer management.It integrates a secure payment gateway for online transactions.
