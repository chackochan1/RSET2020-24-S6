Our app aims to automate live bus ticket booking through QR scanning. The system is an app developed with Flutter SDK and Firebase. The app consists of two main modules: the passenger side and the conductor side. On the passenger side, passengers can add money to their wallets and scan the QR code sticker inside the bus to make payments from their wallets. A ticket will be generated for the specific journey. On the conductor side, the conductor
manages bus routes and activates a particular route at the start of the journey. When the conductor asks passengers to show their tickets, they can display the generated ticket, which the conductor will verify using the always-on display feature containing his active bus routeâ€™s tickets list. Passengers can only book tickets if the conductor has activated a
route on his list of bus routes. Through our app, we aim to provide live ticket booking,ensuring that a ticket is booked only when passengers are inside the bus. 

The project is in bus_t1 folder.Open the folder in android studio or VS code(recommended).Make sure you have the required flutter sdks and plugins installed. Run the "main.dart" file. The app will be opened in your  emulator. Also  make your own firestore database and add the json file and other requirements to this project for ticket transactions.
